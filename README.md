# Neural-Sequence-Decoder-for-Speech-BCI

This repository contains code for training a neural sequence decoder, based on the work involving speech brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) as described in related publications and repositories.

## Overview

The code implements a GRU-based decoder model (GRUDecoder) using PyTorch to translate neural signals into sequences (e.g., phonemes for speech synthesis). It includes scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

This implementation is inspired by the following resources:
